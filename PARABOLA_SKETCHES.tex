:Title: SWAN wave model

SWAN_ (developed by SWAN group, TU Delft, The Netherlands) is a wave spectral numerical model. For Simlating WAves Nearshore, it is necessary to define spatial grids of
physical dominant factors (wind friction, dissipation) as well as define a COMPUTATIONAL
grid on which the model performs its (spectral) calculations: budgeting energy spectra over
each cell of the (computational) grid. Grids might have different spatial resolution and extension.
